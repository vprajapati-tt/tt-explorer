# TT-Explorer
TT-Explorer is a development tool to better visualize, modify, and optimize compiled TT-MLIR Graphs.

## Installation


## How to use
TT-Explorer is built with Google's Model Explorer as a visual backbone, and powered with Python and HTTP API endpoints. Users can use the `notebook.ipynb` file to familiarize themselves with the Python endpoints for rapid development in the Notebook format. Users can also run `tt-explorer web` to get a sense for a simple web-app UI that allows for quick exploration and modification of a TT-Graph.
